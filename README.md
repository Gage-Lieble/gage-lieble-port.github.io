Gage Lieble's Personal Portfolio

This site will allow possible employers and online users to see my skill sets, past cases, and a way to get ahold of me. My portfolio
was built in HTML and CSS using Bootstrap and Flask. As of now (VERSION 1) my nav bar needs some work such as closing when the user scrolls.
My site is also only built for mobile screens so my nexct goal in version 2 is to create a responsive design.

HOW TO RUN:
In order to view the site you must have the index.html, style.css, and the Images folder all located in the same directory. double click the index.html
and it will open in your deafult broswer
