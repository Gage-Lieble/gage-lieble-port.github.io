Gage Lieble's Personal Portfolio

This site will allow possible employers and online users to see my skill sets, past cases, and a way to get ahold of me. My portfolio
was built in HTML and CSS using Bootstrap and Flask. As of now (VERSION 1) my nav bar needs some work such as closing when the user scrolls.
My site is also only built for mobile screens so my nexct goal in version 2 is to create a responsive design.

HOW TO RUN:

FLASK: In order to view the site you must have the app.py file in the directory. inside the directory you must also have a 'templates' folder and a 'static' folder. Place the HTML files in the template folder. Inside the static folder, place the 'Images' folder and the 'style' folder. the 'style' folder must include style.css and bootstrap.css.
- In the terminal type 
- WINDOWS: "$env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"
- MAC: "export FLASK_APP=app.py"
- next you must type
- WINDOWS: "py -m flask run"
- MAC: "flask run"
Lastly once the server is running, Shift click the Local Host Server 5000
and it will open in the deafault browser
^^^THIS IS MAIN FILE FOR PROJECT -- INCLUDES WORKING CONTACT FORM^^^


HTML/CSS only: In order to view the site you must have the index.html, style.css, and the Images folder all located in the same directory. double click the index.html
and it will open in your deafult broswer
^^^THIS SITE DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNCTIONING CONTACT FORM AS OF VERSION 1^^^
